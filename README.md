# Simplex-Method-R-package
The SimplexMethod package provides an efficient implementation of the Simplex Algorithm for solving linear programming (LP) problems. It supports both maximization and minimization of objective functions and allows users to visualize the intermediate steps of the algorithm through detailed simplex table outputs.
